# TIC TAC TOE

In this project, I'm going to be building a TIC TAC TOE game for scratch _with no aid of any libraries or frameworks_.

---

## Overview

### The Challenge
Users should be able to do the following: 

* Be able to play Tic Tac Toe against the IE.
* Be able to pick the sign that they want to play with.

* Be able to change their sign, which will result in the game to restart automatically.

* Be able to restart the game whenever they feel like it by clicking a restart button.

* Be able to pick the level of difficulty of the game by choosing one of the following values for the AI inteligence:

    * Easy
    * Medium
    * Difficult
    * Unbeatable
* The initial state of the game will be:
    * Human player's sign is X.
    * AI's sign is O.
    * AI difficulty is easy.
